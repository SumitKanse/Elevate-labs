Task 1 - basic landing page using html css on VS coding (4 Aug)

# Project Overview

This project includes two simple, linked web pages: a landing page and a second task page. The pages are built using HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling.

- The Landing Page (`index.html`)**: This is the first page a user sees. It has a header at the top and a footer at the bottom, with a main message in the middle. The most important part is the "Get Started" button, which is a link that takes you to the second page.

- The Task Page (`task2.html`)**: This page is the destination when you click the button on the landing page. It also has a header and a footer, and its main content is centered on the screen using a modern CSS trick called **Flexbox**. The header on this page has a link to go back to the landing page.

The two pages are connected by these links, creating a simple, two-page website.
